# Pomodoro Timer
A simple and mobile-responsive productivity timer based off the Pomodoro method - 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes break. I rely on this when I need to focus and also to remind myself to take breaks.

This was built as a project whilst undertaking [freeCodeCamp's Legacy Front End Web Development course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
